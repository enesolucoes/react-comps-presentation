<Notes>
  <p>Components are abstractions.</p>
  <p>Good abstractions allow for extension.</p>
  <p>Consider this component that uses a class attribute for style a button</p>
  <p>This works great until we try to extend it with another class.</p>
  <p>In this case, delete-btn replaces btn. Order matters for JSX spread attributes. The props.className being spread is overriding the className in our component. will never be anything but btn</p>

}
----

<Notes>
  We need to use destructuring assignment to get the incoming className and merge with the base className.

<Notes>
  <p>Providing an array as children is a very common. It's how lists are drawn in React.</p>
  <p>We use map() to create an array of React Elements for every value in the array. That's equivalent to providing a literal array.</p>

<Notes>
  <p>There’s no flexibility!</p>
  <p>What if you wanted to change the rendering order of Chat, maybe by moving the messages below the input? What if you wanted to invert design control of each message over to the user? </p>

<Notes>
  <p>the first step towards a more flexible Chat component by adding three static properties called Messages, Input and Button, with their values equal to the corresponding components</p>
  <p>to refer to these static properties as “sub-components”</p>
</Notes>

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./examples/compound/03.js").default}

<Notes>
  <p>The layout is still hardcoded, going against our flexible philosophy. What we desire is to have the user of the component determine how things render</p>
  <p>to refer to these static properties as “sub-components”</p>
</Notes>

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./examples/compound/04.js").default}
/>

<Notes>
  <p>We’re no longer hardcoding the layout, so users of Chat can explicitly declare it in their own code using the dot-notation syntax</p>
  <p> Let’s simulate this by updating the App component</p>
</Notes>

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./examples/compound/05.js").default}
/>

<Notes>
  <p>Things are slowly starting to take shape, but now the app is broken. All that’s rendering is Chatroom</p>
  <p>At first glance, you might think the solution would be to render this.props.children underneath it</p>
  <p>The error stems from the fact that Chat.Messages is not getting a messages prop the way it did when we were hardcoding the layout in the render method</p>
  <p>We can’t put the onus on the user to pass those props around. They don’t even have access to them. They’re tucked away in a black box. So now the question becomes, how do we keep this flexible component syntax while also passing data?</p>
</Notes>

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./examples/compound/06.js").default}
/>

<Notes>
  <p>React.Children is a top-level API that “provides utilities” for dealing with this.props.children</p>
  <p>One of those utilities is React.Children.map</p>
  <p>After you save, you’ll notice that the error is still there. That’s because we’re still not passing any props to the children. Luckily, React gives us another utility to make this happen.</p>
</Notes>

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./examples/compound/07.js").default}

<Notes>
  <p>the way that my team and I identify specific children as it has worked well for us. We use a property on components called displayName</p>
  <p>You can explicitly add a displayName to any class or function component. It’s the same as adding propTypes or defaultProps</p>
  <p>This value is now accessible on each child inside of the React.Children.map via child.type.displayName:.</p>
</Notes>

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./examples/compound/08.js").default}
  steps={[

<Notes>
  <p>identifying specific children of the Chat component using their set displayName, cloning them, and passing each custom props.</p>
  <p>The lingering error message should now be gone and everything should be working properly! You just wrote your first compound component, albeit a pretty basic one</p>
</Notes>

---

# Drawbacks

<Notes>
  <p>What would happen if you wanted to wrap any of the sub-components in another component, or even a simple div</p>
  <p>because Chat.Button is no longer a direct child of Chat. That seat is now held by the innocent looking div element. This is where the limitations of React.Children.map begin to show. If you really want to craft a flexible compound component, you’ll have to take things a step further (more below).</p>

<Notes>
  <p>In my opinion, the biggest drawback surrounds React.Children.map. Not only does it bloat the render method, but it also has the limitation of only giving you access to the direct children of the component you’re rendering.</p>

<Notes>
  <p>The Chat component will need to be refactored so that it renders the Provider</p>

</Notes>

---

<CodeSurfer
  title="Provendo Context"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./examples/provider/05.js").default}
/>

<Notes>
  <p>The ChatContext.Provider requires a single prop named value.</p>
  <p>This prop can be thought of simply as the actual context being provided, and any underlying Consumers will have access to it.</p>
  <p>Messages requires a messages prop Input requires a value prop and an onChange prop Button requires an onClick prop</p>
  <p>The values of these props all exist somewhere in the Chat component, either in this.state or as class methods. We can combine them into a single object and assign it to the value prop for ChatContext.Provider</p>
  <p>The first way is to simply create a new object, we’ll call it context, at the top of the render method with all the necessary data inside of it. Then we can pass that object to ChatContext.Provider</p>
  <p>Although this works, there is a significant downside. The context object must be re-created every time the Chat component renders, even if none of the values inside of the object have changed. This will inevitably cause some unnecessary re-rendering of the components below.</p>
</Notes>

---

<CodeSurfer
  title="Provendo Context"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./examples/provider/06.js").default}

<Notes>
  <p>The second and more performant way to handle this would be to add the methods to the state object of Chat, and pass the state directly to ChatContext.Provider</p>

<Notes>
  <p>In each sub-component you can now import ChatConsumer and render it as the root element of each.</p>
  <p>Before this refactor, the sub-components of Chat relied on props passed in during the React.cloneElement process. Now, instead of mapping through each child and cloning them, they can each explicitly declare what data they need from the Provider above.</p>

# Render Prop Pattern

<Notes>
  <p>The concept of children as a function or child as a function, also called render prop in general, is one of the advanced patterns in React</p>
  <p>The components which implement this pattern could be called render prop components.</p>

    { range: [20, 32] }
  ]}
/>

<Notes>
  <p>let’s implement a new React component next to the App component where you can increment (and decrement) a number</p>
  <p>In this case, the abstract number will be the amount of US Dollar which should be converted to other currencies later on</p>
</Notes>

---

<CodeSurfer
  title="Render Prop"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./examples/render-prop/03.js").default}

<Notes>
  <p>Now let’s tap into the problem space where render props or alternatives can be applied for this scenario</p>
  <p>What if you want to use the amount, which is set to the state of the Amount component, in dedicated currency components which apply the exchange rate</p>
</Notes>

---

<CodeSurfer
  title="Render Prop"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./examples/render-prop/04.js").default}
/>

<Notes>
  <p>The naive approach would be to render the currency components within the Amount component</p>
  <p>It’s totally valid doing it this way. The major advantage here is the simplicity of it. If there is no strong use case of having more control about what is rendered within the Amount component, you can go for it. </p>
  <p>However, the disadvantage is that the Amount component has to know about the currency components now.</p>
  <p>So what if you could just leave the Amount component as it was before and get the currency components outside of it?</p>

    { lines: [34, 36, 38, 41] }
  ]}

<Notes>
  <p> because the currency components don’t know about the amount now. You would have to lift the state from the Amount component to the App component</p>
  <p>All state is managed by the App component and the currency components and the Amount component only receive props.</p>
  <p>he implementation for managing the state was kept the same, it was only lifted up to the App component. So this approach would be a valid solution to the problem.</p>
  <p>But wait, what about component composition in React with its children prop? This should work too, shouldn’t it? </p>
</Notes>

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./examples/render-prop/06.js").default}
  steps={[
    { notes: '' },
    { lines: [30] }
  ]}
/>

<Notes>
  <p>Let’s revert the components to their old implementation and see how this would look like.</p>
  <p>The Amount component would get control over the amount state again. In addition to the previous version, it would render the children prop for the composition too</p>
</Notes>

---

<CodeSurfer
  code={require("!raw-loader!./examples/render-prop/07.js").default}
/>

<Notes>
  <p>Now the App component could pass the currency components as children prop to the Amount component</p>
  <p>However, again you would have to lift state up to the App component in order to pass the amount to the currency components. </p>
  <p>As you can see, the component composition on its own doesn’t help us to solve the problem. That’s the point where React’s render props pattern comes into play which enhances React’s component composition with an important ingredient: a render function.</p>

<Notes>
  <p>The render prop pattern enhances React’s patterns for compositions</p>
  <p>Instead of passing the currency components as components, you pass them as a function which renders them</p>

  code={require("!raw-loader!./examples/render-prop/09.js").default}
  steps={[
    { notes: '' },

<Notes>
  <p>It gives you a way to pass data from the wrapping component (Amount) to its inner composed component(s) (currency components)</p>
  <p>Instead of passing the currency components as components, you pass them as a function which renders them</p>
  <p>The children prop becomes a children as a function.</p>

  steps={[
    { notes: '' },
    { lines: [3,5,6] },
    { lines: [41] },
  ]}
/>

<Notes>
  <p>Rather than using the children directly to render them, you have to call it as function now, because the children are passed as function to the Amount component in the first place</p>
  <p>However, since you are using children as a function now, you can pass the amount state to the function and access it as argument in the function signature outside of the Amount component</p>
  <p>That’s the crucial point for the render prop pattern. In this case, the Amount component became a render prop component, because it implements the render prop pattern, and uses a children as a function or also called child as a function to pass its own state (or other data) to the composed components (here currency components)</p>

# High Order Components (HOC) 🎸

<Notes>
  <p>Let’s say that we want to extract the logging logic out of these functions without changing their signatures. How can we do this? An elegant solution is to write a higher-order function, that is, a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a function.</p>
  <p>These two functions are not very useful but they help us demonstrate a pattern that we can later apply to components.</p>

<Notes>
  <p>Then it could be used by passing an array of currency components to the HOC:</p>
  <p>And finally using it in your App component:</p>
  <p>in this case you would lose the possibility to render something in between. You are strictly coupled to the higher-order component’s render method</p>
  <p>If you need to add something in between of the currency components, you would have to do it in the higher-order component.</p>

  <p>w, the component has no access to the this object and therefore no access to this.state or this.setState. Next, use the withState higher-order component from recompose to enhance the App component.</p>

  <p>It may be simpler to read it this way:</p>

  <p> How can React render props be used to make a functional component stateful? </p>
  <p>Since there is no recompose for render prop components, you have to implement a render prop for it yourself</p>
